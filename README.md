# React Boilerplate

This is a starting point for a React web app project, using my preferred setup.

## Getting Started

1. Install Yarn (follow installation instructions [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](here)).
1. `git clone` this repository.
1. `cd` to the directory you cloned this repository to.
1. `yarn dev` to run the development server (it should open in your default browser).

## Technologies Used

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) - package manager
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI framework
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - bundler / development server
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript compiler
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - static typing for JavaScript

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
